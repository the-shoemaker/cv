    In addition to learning
    the compulsory curriculum, the Steiner School emphasizes on
    self-motivated learning. I am very happy to have been allowed to
    attend these additional 3 years of my obligatory school here.

    Given that my elderly siblings attended the Steiner School, it
    was only natural for me to spend my obligatory school years there.
