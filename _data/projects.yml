    I love to capture the world aground me while taking long strolls
    through the city and nature.

    Embracing the vegetarain life-style

    After becoming a vegetarain two years ago, I became interest in cooking.

    I prepare a weekly supper for my family, and love to experiment with new
    ingredients and recipes.

    Broken isn't a permanent state.<br>It's a challenge!

    I love to tinker and solder. Mostly small projects. When I find a broken device,
    I find a new mission.

    Screwdrivers and solder-iron are my definition of fun!
